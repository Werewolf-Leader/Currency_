# Currency Exchange Rate Monitor and Email Alert Agent

## Overview

The Currency Exchange Rate Monitor and Email Alert Agent is a Python script that continuously monitors currency exchange rates for a specified currency pair and sends email alerts when the exchange rate crosses user-defined thresholds. This agent utilizes the uAgents library for its core functionality.

## Features

- Allows users to specify the base currency and target currency to monitor.
- Fetches real-time exchange rates using an external API.
- Sends email alerts when the exchange rate crosses predefined upper and lower thresholds.
- Can be scheduled to run at specified intervals to monitor currency rates.

## Prerequisites

Before using this agent, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed.
- The uAgents library installed.
- The requests library installed (for making API requests).
- Access to an email account (e.g., Gmail) for sending email alerts.
- Twilio API credentials (if using SMS alerts).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the Python script.

2. Modify the following variables in the script:

   - `agent.name`: Set the name of your agent.
   - `agent.endpoint`: Update the endpoint if needed.
   - `agent.seed`: Set your recovery phrase for the agent.

3. Configure the base currency, target currency, and threshold values in the `check_thresholds` function.

4. Set up your email credentials:

   - `sender_email`: Your email address.
   - `sender_password`: Your email password.
   - `receiver_email`: The recipient's email address.

5. Replace `your_recovery_phrase_here` with your actual recovery phrase.

6. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python currency_monitor_agent.py

The agent will start monitoring the exchange rate at the specified intervals and send email alerts when necessary.
Customization
